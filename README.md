# Phaser Editor 2D - v3

[Phaser Editor 2D](https://phasereditor2d.com) is a web-based IDE to develop HTML5 games. The games are powered by the popular [Phaser](https://phaser.io) framework.

This is a full re-write of the editor, using web technologies.

Previous versions of the editor are based on the [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org). Both are hosted [here](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/PhaserEditor).

*We are an independent developer. Phaser Editor is not part of the Phaser project. Contact them at [phaser.io](https://phaser.io)*


### Main features


* The IDE runs in the browser. It has a small backend that can be run in the cloud or locally.

* It is lightweight and is focused on visual tools.

* However, it provides basic editors for coding JavaScript/TypeScript.

* Friendly for collaborators: it is coded in TypeScript and provides an extensible framework. The server side is coded in [Go](https://golang.org).

* It follows the Phaser standards and API. Extra plugins or runtimes are not required.


### Documentation

Phaser Editor 2D v3 is [fully documented](https://help.phasereditor2d.com).

### Download

You can get the binaries in the [website downloads](https://phasereditor2d.com/downloads).

### Build and run

At this moment you cannot build and run Phaser Editor v3. The server is not part of this repository. As soon as the editor is released we are going to publish the instructions to build and run it.

### Licensing

The code provided in this repository is under the MIT license.

The editor code is divided into two parts: the front-end (the HTML5-based IDE, or client) and the back-end (the HTTP server). This repository contains the full code of the client, that is the bigger part. The server code is closed.
